### Version 4.0.1

THEMES

    Adaptive Theme

    gruvbox is now an adaptive theme. Added a `gruvbox.sublime-theme`, which will automatically adapt to your current color scheme.
    Consider this a beta release of the adaptive theme. Things should be working, but I can't make any promises!

    First and foremost, the adaptive theme was created as a single theme which could be used with any gruvbox color scheme.
    It will adapt to non-gruvbox schemes, but it might not look pretty. Try it out!

    To support the adaptive theme, a few theme options had to be removed. These options no longer have any effect:

    - "gruvbox_accent_opposite": true, // Use the other mode's accent color; IE: Use Light theme's red with Dark theme
    - "gruvbox_accent_neutral": true,  // Use brightness-mode-neutral accent color

    The old, non-adaptive themes had to be discontinued because of the change to existing assets to support the adaptive theme.
